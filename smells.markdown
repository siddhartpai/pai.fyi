Develop an app where we connect people (dating) (networking) who like similar smells

Crazy idea behind this 

People who like some smells would probably enjoy doing something thatâ€™s associated with liking the smell.\
It is something they both would have in common\
For example the love for petrol smells might mean the person has an affinity with cars and driving them. \
The love for smells of rotting wood/cowdung might mean the person has an affinity towards gardening related activities\
If they liked the smell of a book they probably have loved to read at some point in their lives 

These smells do regulate our daily lives. They have a constant smell profile which pervades the air. 

If you go into a new house, the smell is different. ( what is that feeling you are having right now? ) \
If you go into your home the smell of the home is different. When you go faraway more than anything it is the smell of the house you are craving for.
